        <h1>Quartz-H2 introduction, Q&A</h1>
        <h4>Why should I try qh2 server?</h4>
        It offers first class support for h2 and h2c protocols. H2 binary
        package exchange fits nicely into functional effectful stream concept.
        You just evaluate your stream description into packets as soon as they
        go. Cats effect library offers blazingly fast green thread (fiber)
        support. Given the multiplexing nature of H2 protocol, which can process
        several virtual stream in one connection, it was natural to adopt one
        CATS effect fiber per H2 stream approach. It efficiently process several
        files per one connection. Thanks to H2 and Cats Effect thread to fibers
        management. Also, it properly implements H2 flow control, so if one of
        your fs2 stream sinks slows down, your h2 transmit window update will be
        delayed accordingly.
        <h4>What is h2 and h2c</h4>
        h2 means http/2 protocol with TLS encryption, this is the one which all
        modern browsers support. h2c is plain text unencrypted http/2, can be
        used with third party clients but not with browsers.
        <h4>
            By default TLS encryption is on, it uses self-signed cert for demo
            purposes and you need to approve selfsigned cert in the browser. Do
            we realy need this security out of the box?
        </h4>
        The server was written from top to bottom, which means that TLS data
        found its way to HTTP/2 frames starting from day 1. Later as PoC we
        added transparent support (with netio) for plain text HTTP/2 and
        HTTP/1.1 with chunked encoding only. Modern browsers are simply not
        aware that HTTP/2 plain text exists. However Quartz-H2 supports plain
        h2c protocol as well. QH2 is an implementation of h2 protocol and the
        rest of modes are just extensions. This is first class HTTP/2 packet
        streamer and not the extension on top oh http1.
        <h4>Server has sync and async mode, what's the difference?</h4>
        Async mode is Java NIO async callback wraped up into IO.async along with
        TLS encryption done as IO effects. Thanks to netio transparency, you can
        select any mode with SSL or without.
        <br />Sync mode is just tradional Java sockets on CATS Effect's blocking
        pool.
        <h4>
            Server works with fs2 streams, how do I know the Content-Length?
        </h4>
        Content-Length is optional for http/2 protocol. In fall back mode with
        http/1.1 chunked encoding is always used. Your fs2 streams are always
        good and ready to be evaluated as long as you need them to. Below,
        example of Response for file streaming with fs2.
        <div>
            <code>
                Response.Ok().asStream(fs2.io.readInputStream(IO(jstream),
                BLOCK_SIZE,
                true)).contentType(ContentType.contentTypeFromFileName(fname)))
            </code>
        </div>
        <h4>Server software written in Cats Effect why you don't use F[_]</h4>
        The server is written directly for cats.IO, which implements all
        necessary type classes. The background of the server's design has its
        roots in the ZIO library. The latest Cats Effect library does everything
        that ZIO 1.0 used to do, but faster. We all miss the lightness and speed
        of ZIO 1.0. Luckily, Cats Effect 3.0 was the perfect answer. We aren't
        entirely against the idea of converting code to F[_] style in a separate
        codebase, time will tell whether it is worthwhile.
        <h4>
            Does it support Tapir, an HTTP API definition library from
            SoftwareMill
        </h4>
        Yes, it does. Yet supports more complex cases as well, such as http
        multipart, http ranged, and websockets. You will need tapir server
        interpreter provided as separate jar tapir-quartz-h2.jar
